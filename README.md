# Authentication
https://www.atauthentication.com

Modular, strongly typed, promise based, independent implementations of various
authentication protocols. These libraries don't have a perfectly uniform API and
they don't include session management. This means you can use them regardless of
your choice of framework.

A lot of this code has been copied (with some modificaiton) from the excellent
http://passportjs.org/ project, but I felt it was a shame that all that code was
so locked into the passport framework. My hope is that `@authentication`
provides primatives to allow experimenting with alternative high-level APIs.
